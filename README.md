# codelou-git
Greetings, and thanks for checking out William Spencer's
Narrative Nonsense project.  Out of interest in world events I 
thought it would be engaging to create my first website for 
political analysis and discussion.  

You will find featured in this project, the applicatin of flexbox in
main.css and bootstrap in index.html for items like the sticky page title, 
the vertical nav bar and the modal (popup).  Note that jQuery and bootstrap
links are sourced within the coding.  

Use of color and svg and jpg pics mixed with content, layout and sizing
was applied. Responsive design does not use media queries but uses divs, 
sizing, strategic placement.  

In the vertical Navbar thus far, only the about page has been created, so
click that link to open more content on a different page.

The popup modal is built to have a simple popup with content, hopefully content
that can simplify ideas with links and make them more compelling through clicking.
The popup idea is to have a weekly analysis or summarizations of ogoing or new 
topics.  For a working page, I may add a link
on the page to open all archived modal analysis summaries done on the site. 

The design of this page would be expanded on to include new items, like 
new links and new departments, one of which I would like to add to
be podcast discussions and interviews.  

Thanks again for visiting.  ---- William Spencer, March, 22, 2019
