    <h1>Nugget Knowledge</h1>
    <h2>Facts, Themes, Observations, Questions, and Opinions</h2>
    <h4>'Just the facts please!' is an assertion that leads to
        gathering evidence and using critical thinking with logic to get closer to the truth and lay aside
        false claims. Themes emerge from facts as observations are made about connections. This section populates
        nuggets of data, analysed in simple small clusters, takaways that are quick and easy to catch at least a
        feel or a flavor with resources provided to delve deeper and conduct your own research to click in now or
        or retrun to later. Themes like the 'divide and conquor' theme can be identified across history in
        various settings. As such this section is to call out such themes where applicable for both recent
        events and more distant historical events.</h4>
