    <h1>Nugget Knowledge</h1>
    <h2>Facts, Themes, Observations, Questions, and Opinions</h2>
    <h4>'Just the facts please!' is an assertion that leads to
        gathering evidence and using critical thinking with logic to get closer to the truth and lay aside
        false claims. Themes emerge from facts as observations are made about connections. This section populates
        nuggets of data, analysed in simple small clusters, takaways that are quick and easy to catch and understand.
        The 'divide and conquor' theme can be identified across history in various settings. As such
        this section is to call out such themes where applicable for both recent events and more distant historical
        events.</h4>
