        <h2>Balkan Wars of the 1990s</h2>
        <h3>This Nugget barely scratches the surface</h3>
        <h4>Nonsense Radar: Notice:<br>
            1) Villification of an Ethnic group by major Western mouthpieces.<br>
            2) Surmising the conflict as one that began strictly as a locol conflict or because of Ethnic tensions.
        </h4>
        <h3>Themes of the Balkans in the 90's include, 'Divide and Conquor', 'overthrow', 'Colonizing',i
            'destruction by ngos and foreign aid', 'bad-guy propaganda', 'foreign economic plunder'

        <p>During the 1992 to 1995 Bosnian War, Mujahideen and other Jihadi fighters
            came from Afganistan and other places to support the Bosnian Muslim forces and fight the Serbs.
            The United States actively armed these Jihadi groups.

        <p>In the Kosovo war, NATO conducted airstrikes on Serbia from March 24th to June 10, 1999, for 78 days
            straight,
            and some of the bombs dropped were laced with depleted Uranium

        <h4>More Questions: Why did the US media single out the Serbs as the bad guys when atrocities
            were being committed all around? Was there a hidden agenda the US had? or NATO? Was it to
            carve out of Serbia and establish Kosovo as a Western aligned country? What
            are the implications for today and the future in terms of peace in the Balkans,
            trade between the Balkans and Western Europe, or Russia? Were the 2 wars good for American Business?
