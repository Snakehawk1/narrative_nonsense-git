        <h2>Balkan Wars of the 1990s</h2>
        <h3>Motivation: When the Balkans War Happened I was involved with sponsoring a Bosnian Refugee Family.
            What I believed then, based on the news, and what I have come to learn about the forces at
            play outside of the news, has radically changed my view. I had questions and started to look deeper.

        <h3>This Nugget barely scratches the surface</h3>
        <h4>Nonsense Radar: Notice:<br>
            1) Villification of an Ethnic group by major Western mouthpieces.<br>
            2) Surmising the conflict as one that began strictly as a locol conflict or because of Ethnic tensions.

        <h3>Themes of the Balkans in the 90's include, 'Divide and Conquor', 'overthrow', 'Colonizing',
            'destruction by ngos and foreign aid', 'bad-guy propaganda', 'us and them propaganda',
            'foreign economic plunder' 'US backing Jihadis again (and seeding the "war on terror")'
        </h3>

        <h4>In the 1992-1995 war, the US was secrely arming the Bosnian backing Mujahideen to fight against the
            Croats and Serbs and the US was villifying the Serbs. In 1999 NATO bombed
            Serbia for 78 days straight in it's irst unprovoked offensive maneuver. The media in the US was
            strongly pro-Bosnaian Muslim and anti-Serb, spreading the propaganda of the US intelligence apparatus.
            Support of extremist fighters, however, goes back further, at least as far as during the Carter
            administration under the guidance of his foreign intelligence advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski when the
            US armed bandit
            drug-dealing leaders of the Mujahideen in Afghanistan to fight the Soviets in the 1979-1989 Soviet War
            in Afghanistan. Osama Bin Laden, during that conflict started, an international organization of
            affiliate groups Al Quaida, the Taliban, etc.)
            In the 1990s, The Mujahideen, traveled to the Bosnian war to support the Bosnian Muslims,
            where it again was armed by the US, but by the end of the 1990s Jihadi groups had become a threat,
            evidenced by the US embassy bombing in Nairobi Kenya in 1998 and other attacks. The Bosnian wars of the
            1990s
            therefore, draw in a complex context of preceeding and following events that underscore the intense backlash
            and escalation of violence caused by covert US activities with profit agendas geared to beneift only a few.

        <p>During the 1992 to 1995 Bosnian War, Mujahideen and other Jihadi fighters
            came from Afganistan and other places to support the Bosnian Muslim forces and fight the Serbs.
            The United States secretly and actively armed these Jihadi groups and demonized specifically the
            Serbs across the former Yugoslavia.

        <p>A very interesting 26 minute discussion looks at Russia today and in 1999 and toward the end Alex Christoforu
            asks about the tipping point event that caused people to recoil from the Globalist agenda.
            Hint: It was when there were "European Christians bombing European Christians" and Christophoru was in the
            region where it took place at the time it happened.<a

        <h4>More Questions: Why did the US media single out the Serbs as the bad guys when atrocities
            were being committed all around? Was there a hidden agenda the US had? or NATO? Was it to
            carve out of Serbia and establish Kosovo as a Western aligned country? What
            are the implications for today and the future in terms of peace in the Balkans,
            trade between the Balkans and Western Europe, or Russia? Were the 2 wars good for American Business?
