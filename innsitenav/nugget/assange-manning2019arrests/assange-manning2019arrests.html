        <h3> Nonsense Radar: "These two have endangered the US Military" <br>
            If justice prevails, the only US Military that would be endangered
            would be the ones who should be locked up or the people they threaten,
            murder or incarcerate (like Assange and Manning) to prevent themselves
            from ever being exposed.
