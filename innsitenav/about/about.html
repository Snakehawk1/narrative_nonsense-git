    <h1>About Narrative Nonsense</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>After the 2016 election I got possessed with exploring
    alternate sites on the web to find out what is really going on.
    At some point, I started to think about joining in public discourse
    on the events of the day and the historical context.  This is how I
    got interested in political commentary and web design to build a 
    presence of my own for discourse and ideas on the web.  I chose 
    narrative_nonsense for a site title after brainstorming a slew of 
    more serious names and realizing I wanted to somehow throw humor 
    into an otherwise not so humorous subject and not take myself or my 
    website too seriously.  narrative_nonsense actually underscores 
    a lot of nonsese put out in the government and media narratives today.  
    I move from being agitated by world events and the false narratives
    given, to being quiet and peaceful in spite of it, simply satisfied
    to feel that I am getting better at noticing the powers of influence 
    and spin at play.</h2>

    <h2>I have a crazy idea that if more people become more educated in critical thinking, 
    we might hold off the weilders of power from gaining at the average person's expense.  
    I understand the majority who stay away from news given how often news is 
    intentionally presented in confusing ways, or is ignored, or is chaotic.
    But sometimes I get frustrated with the same people for not fighting
    back.  It seems like so many of the ways people get off track is by following
    a leader, a party, a government or an "expert" or by subscribing to the 
    'acepted' narrative religiously, without questioning it. 
    <br><br>
    This site is my first step at playing with technology to bring
    insight, critical analysis, heart and humor into a fun presentation that will
    eventually employ a lot more clicking to allow people to snap their way into 
    fun discovery of otherwise heady, difficult material that too often is about
    the failings of the human spirit as in planners who set up wars and tragedies and 
    regular people who go to the front lines and carry them out.  Most people want
    a world that works for everyone, not just an elite few, and most people care.
    My goal is to build a discourse that will somehow cultivate people's capacity to
    employ human spirit with wisdom.  I hope you find this site
    meaningful and enjoyable.  William Spencer March 23, 2019
